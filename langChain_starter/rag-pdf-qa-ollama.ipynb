    "## Levers in the RAG pipeline\n",
    "RAG is quite tricky to get right, especially if you need it to be efficient. There are many levers we can pull in our pipeline, which influence the following things:\n",
    "* How fast we can get our answers;\n",
    "* How relevant our answers are (and related, how likely we are to get a hallucination);\n",
    "* How complete our answers are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's instantiate our PDF questioner with the following values:\n",
    "* `model`: the LLM used to generate answers using information from the document. In this case, `gpt-3.5-turbo`.\n",
    "* `pdf_document`: the PDF we want to \"chat with\". In our case, we've selected our PDF containing almost all of the PyCharm documentation.\n",
    "* `chunk_size`: the maximum number of tokens to include in each chunk. We've selected 1000.\n",
    "* `chunk_overlap`: the number of tokens that should overlap between adjacent chunks. We've selected 0, so no overlapping tokens.\n",
    "* `search_type`: the metric by which chunks are selected. In this case, we've selected \"similarity\", so those chunks with the highest (cosine) similarity to the content of the question we're asking. However, you can also use \"mmr\" (if supported by your document store) which tries to maximise for relevancy and diversity of results.\n",
    "* `n_documents`: the maximum number of chunks to use to generate the answer. In this case, we've used 5.\n",
    "* `chain_type`: this controls how the content is passed into the LLM. In the case of \"stuff\" it passes all gathered context chunks into the context window at once. Other options are \"refine\", which feeds in the chunks in batches, plus the answer generated so far, and \"map-rerank\", which feeds in each chunk and assigns a score based on how well it answered the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other levers I've chosen not to make arguments in this class are the model used for embeddings (the `OpenAIEmbeddings` were used) and which vector database we use to store the document embeddings (in this case, the `Chroma` vector store was used)."

      "\"I have written sixty kopecks' worth,\" he would say with a smile. Braga's \"Serenade\" was the fashion at that time, and Chekhov was fond of hearing Potapenko play it on the violin while Miss Mizinov sang it. Having been a student at the Moscow University, Chekhov liked to celebrate St. Tatyana's Day. He never missed making a holiday of it when he lived in Moscow. That winter, for the first time, he chanced to be in Petersburg on the 12th of January. He did not forget \"St. Tatyana,\" and assembled all his literary friends on that day in a Petersburg restaurant. They made speeches and kept the holiday, and this festivity initiated by him was so successful that the authors went on meeting regularly afterwards.\n",

I shall celebrate my name-day at the Maly Yaroslavets restaurant, from the restaurant to the benefit performance, from the benefit performance to the restaurant again. I am working, but with very great difficulty. No sooner have I written a line than the bell rings and someone comes in to talk to me about Sahalin. It's simply awful! ...\n",

      "The winter of 1893 was a severe one with a great deal of snow. The snow was so high under the windows that the hares who ran into the garden stood on their hind-legs and looked into the window of Chekhov's study. The swept paths in the garden were like deep trenches. By then Chekhov had finished his work in connection with the cholera and he began to live the life of a hermit. His sister found employment in Moscow; only his father and mother were left with him in the house, and the hours seemed very long. They went to bed even earlier than in the summer, but Chekhov would wake up at one in the morning, sit down to his work and then go back to bed and sleep again. At six o'clock in the morning all the household was up. Chekhov wrote a great deal that winter. But as soon as visitors arrived, life was completely transformed. There was singing, playing on the piano, laughter. Chekhov's mother did her utmost to load the tables with dainties; his father with a mysterious air would produce various specially prepared cordials and liqueurs from some hidden recess; and then it seemed that Melihovo had something of its own, peculiar to it, which could be found in no other country estate. Chekhov was always particularly pleased at the visits of Miss Mizinov and of Potapenko. He was particularly fond of them, and his whole family rejoiced at their arrival. They stayed up long after midnight on such days, and Chekhov wrote only by snatches. And every time he wrote five or six lines, he would get up again and go back to his visitors.\n",

      "DOCUMENT 4\n",
      "Keep well and be happy. I heard Masha was sending you a letter, and so I hasten to write these few lines. [Footnote: Chekhov's later letters to O. L. Knipper have not been published.] TO HIS SISTER. YALTA, September 9, 1900. DEAR MASHA, I answer the letter in which you write about Mother. To my thinking it would be better for her to go to Moscow now in the autumn and not after December. She will be tired of Moscow and pining for Yalta in a month, you know, and if you take her to Moscow in the autumn she will be back in Yalta before Christmas. That's how it seems to me, but possibly I am mistaken; in any case you must take into consideration that it is much drearier in Yalta before Christmas than it is after--infinitely drearier.\n",

      "He spent the autumn in Moscow, and at the beginning of December went to the French Riviera, settled in Nice, and dreamed again of a visit to Africa, but went instead to Rome. Here, as usual, he met with severe weather. Early in February he returned to Yalta. That year there was a soft, sunny spring. Chekhov spent whole days in the open air, engaged in his favourite occupations; he planted and pruned trees, looked after his garden, ordered all sorts of seeds, and watched them coming up. At the same time he was working on behalf of the invalids coming to Yalta, who appealed to him for help, and also completing the library he had founded at Taganrog, and planning to open a picture gallery there. In May, 1901, Chekhov went to Moscow and was thoroughly examined by a physician, who urged him to go at once to Switzerland or to take a koumiss cure. Chekhov preferred the latter.\n"
